// IMP

// In NON-STRICT MODE
// this substitution happens.
// inside a function If the value of this keyword is null or undefined then it is replaced by the global obejct.


// so you are running the script in non-strict mode and this is undefined/null then it will be replace by global object.
// but if you change to strict mode then this keyword is not replaced by global object.

//so this substitution happens in non-strict mode.
// and strict mode bans this substitution.
