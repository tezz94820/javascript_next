//block :- it is a way in javascript and other programming language to give multiple statement where the language is expecting only one statement.
//for ex :- if() true ; if statement expects only one statement so we dont need block but when we need to give 
//multiple statement we need to use block.
// for ex : - for loop and while loop and function . and arrow function..
